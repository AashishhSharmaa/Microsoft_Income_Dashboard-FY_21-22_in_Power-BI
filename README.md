# Microsoft Income Statement

In this project, I created a Microsoft Income Statement dashboard for the fiscal years 2021 and 2022 in Power BI. By harnessing Power BI's capabilities, I transformed financial data into an interactive and visually compelling dashboard, highlighting crucial metrics for FY 2021 and FY 2022. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for comprehensive exploration and analysis of Microsoft's financial performance during the specified periods.
